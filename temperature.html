    <!-- Hi me, This is not working as smoothly as I'd like.
    See JS file - needs to convert input into uppercase (should be relatively easy)
    Plus the html is a bit naff.
    To do: 
        1. Get the programme running smoothly
        2. Write the html myself
    -->
    <!doctype html> 

<html>

<head>
    <script type='text/javascript' src='temperature.js'></script> <!-- this is the line that links to the example.js file -->
                                                                <!-- to link a different file, just replace 'example.js' with 
                                                                a different file name -->
